# Feature Specification: OHLCV Data Collector MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-ohlcv-data-collector`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "OHLCV Data Collector MVP - Vision Statement"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative researcher or algorithmic trader, I need a reliable system that automatically collects and maintains complete historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for cryptocurrency markets, so that I can backtest trading strategies with confidence in data accuracy and completeness, without spending time on manual data maintenance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new trading pair is configured for collection, **When** the system performs its first data sync, **Then** it retrieves all available historical daily OHLCV data from Coinbase and stores it with 100% completeness for available periods
2. **Given** the system is running continuously, **When** a new daily candle becomes available, **Then** the system automatically collects and stores the new data within 30 minutes of availability
3. **Given** historical data exists with gaps due to exchange outages, **When** the system performs its self-healing routine, **Then** it identifies and fills all gaps where data is now available
4. **Given** collected OHLCV data exists in storage, **When** a user queries for a specific date range and trading pair, **Then** the system returns complete data with indicators for any periods where data is genuinely unavailable
5. **Given** a data anomaly is detected (e.g., price spike exceeding 500% in a single candle or volume exceeding 10x the 30-day average), **When** validation runs, **Then** the system flags the anomaly for review while preserving the original data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Coinbase API is unavailable for extended periods?
- How does system handle retroactive data corrections from the exchange?
- What occurs when attempting to collect data for a delisted trading pair?
- How does system respond when storage capacity approaches limits?
- What happens if duplicate data is received for the same timestamp?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST collect daily OHLCV data (open, high, low, close, volume) for configured cryptocurrency trading pairs
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect and fill gaps in historical data without manual intervention
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain 99.9% or higher data completeness for periods where exchange data is available
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate collected data for anomalies including price spikes exceeding 500% between consecutive candles, volume exceeding 10x the 30-day moving average, negative prices, missing required fields (open, high, low, close, volume), and logical inconsistencies (high < low, close outside high/low range)
- **FR-005**: System MUST update historical data automatically every hour for the most recent 7 days and daily for all older data
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow addition of new trading pairs with configuration time not exceeding 5 minutes including initial historical data sync
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain 99% uptime with automatic recovery from failures
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide data retrieval interface for querying OHLCV data by trading pair and date range
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all collected OHLCV data indefinitely with no automatic deletion
- **FR-010**: System MUST track data collection metadata including collection timestamp, source, and validation status
- **FR-011**: System MUST support expansion to multiple timeframes including 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, 4-hour, and weekly candles
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all data collection activities, errors, and recovery actions for audit purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle rate limiting from exchange APIs gracefully without data loss
- **FR-014**: System MUST notify system administrators via configurable alert channels (initially system logs with severity ERROR, expandable to email/webhook) when data completeness falls below 99.9%
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure data consistency when multiple collection processes run simultaneously

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OHLCV Candle**: Represents price and volume data for a specific trading pair at a specific time interval, containing open price, high price, low price, close price, volume, and timestamp
- **Trading Pair**: Represents a tradeable market (e.g., BTC-USD), including base currency, quote currency, and exchange source
- **Data Gap**: Represents a missing period in the historical data timeline, tracking start time, end time, and resolution status
- **Collection Job**: Represents a data collection task, including target trading pair, time range, status, and results
- **Data Validation Result**: Represents the outcome of data quality checks, including anomalies detected, validation rules applied, and severity levels
- **Exchange Source**: Represents a data provider (initially Coinbase), including API endpoints, rate limits, and supported trading pairs
